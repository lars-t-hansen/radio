  <!-- Must have (once what we have is working):

       Get rid of previous/next and instead make each playlist element
       clickable and the playlist properly scrollable.

       Maybe display the current track under the controls, not over,
       with a line below it or somesuch.

       Extra credit:

       The currently playing song might be displayed in the middle of
       that list and boldfaced, so that we can get rid of the status
       line, leaving only controls and playlist.

       If scrolling moves the current song out of the middle there
       should be some way to get it back, either by a timeout (30s w/o
       activity scrolls us back) or by some action.

       There should be some interactive way of adding channels, don't
       know how...  maybe a different page altogether, since that's a
       desktop form factor.  -->
